# Design Patterns in Java

This document provides an overview of various design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like blueprints that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
- **Prototype**: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

## Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.

## Conclusion
Understanding and implementing design patterns can greatly improve the flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of your code. This document serves as a quick reference to the most common design patterns in Java.
