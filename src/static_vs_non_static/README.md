## Static vs. Non-Static Methods

### Static Methods
- Defined using the `static` keyword.
- Belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
- Can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- Cannot access non-static variables or methods directly.
- Can access static variables and methods directly.
- Used for utility methods, helper functions, etc.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class MathUtils {
        public static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    ```
- Usage:
    ```java
    int sum = MathUtils.add(5, 3);
    ```
  
### Non-Static Methods
- Defined without the `static` keyword.
- Belongs to an instance of the class.
- Can only be called on an instance of the class.
- Can access both static and non-static variables and methods directly.
- Used for operations that require access to instance-specific data.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
        
        public void setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        
        public String getName() {
            return name;
        }
    }
    ```
- Usage:
    ```java
    Person person = new Person();
    person.setName("Alice");
    String name = person.getName();
    ```
  
## Static vs. Non-Static Variables

### Static Variables
- Defined using the `static` keyword.
- Belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
- Shared among all instances of the class.
- Can be accessed using the class name directly.
- Initialized only once when the class is loaded.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class Counter {
        public static int count = 0;
    }
    ```
- Usage:
    ```java
    Counter.count++;
    ```
  
### Non-Static Variables
- Defined without the `static` keyword.
- Belongs to an instance of the class.
- Each instance of the class has its own
- Can only be accessed using an instance of the class.
- Initialized separately for each instance of the class.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class Person {
        private String name;
    }
    ```
- Usage:
    ```java
    Person person1 = new Person();
    person1.name = "Alice";
  
    Person person2 = new Person();
    person2.name = "Bob";
    ```
  
## Static vs. Non-Static Classes

### Static Classes
- Defined using the `static` keyword.
- Nested classes that do not require an instance of the outer class.
- Cannot access non-static members of the outer class directly.
- Can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class.
- Used for grouping related functionality together.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class OuterClass {
        static class InnerClass {
            // Inner class code here
        }
    }
    ```
  
### Non-Static Classes
- Defined without the `static` keyword.
- Require an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.
- Can access non-static members of the outer class directly.
- Used for encapsulating functionality that is closely related to the outer class.
- Example:
    ```java
    public class OuterClass {
        class InnerClass {
            // Inner class code here
        }
    }
    ```
  
## Final Recommendations

### Final Recommendations Detailed
- **Static Methods**: Use static methods for utility functions, helper methods, etc.
- **Non-Static Methods**: Use non-static methods for operations that require access to instance-specific data.
- **Static Variables**: Use static variables for constants, shared data, etc.
- **Non-Static Variables**: Use non-static variables for instance-specific data.
- **Static Classes**: Use static classes for nested classes that do not require an instance of the outer class.
- **Non-Static Classes**: Use non-static classes for encapsulating functionality closely related to the outer class.
- **Final Recommendations Summary**: Use static vs. non-static based on the requirements of your application.
